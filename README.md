# Soccer News App

Android app about female soccer news. This app was originally made fully in Java, but I migrated some classes to Java.

I chose this because Kotlin has much less Boiler-Plate code, so it was easier fixing the static getContext, implementing Room Database like the recommended way and divide the single repository into 2, being one for remote data and other for local data.

## Used technologies

- Room Database
- MVVM
- Retrofit
- Picasso
- ViewBinding
- NavigationComponent
- State Pattern
- Repository Pattern
- LiveData
- Kotlin Coroutines
